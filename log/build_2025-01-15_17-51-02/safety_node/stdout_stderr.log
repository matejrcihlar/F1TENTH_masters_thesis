CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Find{PACKAGE}.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "{PACKAGE}", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "{PACKAGE}" with
  any of the following names:

    {PACKAGE}Config.cmake
    {package}-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "{PACKAGE}" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "{PACKAGE}_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "{PACKAGE}" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
